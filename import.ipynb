    "## Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Output a single structured JSON file** with metadata, nodes, and relationships\n",
    "2. **Include proper metadata section** with generation timestamp and counts\n",
    "3. **Structure nodes and relationships** in separate arrays within the JSON\n",
    "4. **Process literary content** - extract entities from book chapters and text chunks\n",
    "5. **Maintain hierarchical structure** - ensure Book→Chapter→Chunk relationships\n",
    "6. **Identify literary elements** - characters, settings, events, themes from text\n",
    "7. **Use sequential timestamps** to reflect narrative progression and chunk ordering\n",
    "8. **Reference node IDs correctly** - relationships must reference existing node IDs\n",
    "9. **Handle chunk ordering** - use chunk_order_number in properties for temporal sequencing\n",
    "10. **Include meaningful properties** - add relevant metadata to both nodes and relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical JSON Formatting Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use proper JSON syntax** - valid JSON with correct escaping\n",
    "- **Escape special characters** - quotes, backslashes, and control characters\n",
    "- **Use consistent data types** - integers for IDs, strings for text, floats for weights\n",
    "- **Include all required fields** - id, label, name, description for nodes; start_id, end_id, relationship_type, weight for relationships\n",
    "- **Maintain valid structure** - proper nesting and array formatting\n",
    "- **Use ISO timestamps** - consistent datetime format throughout\n",
    "\n",
    "### Literary Processing Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract characters** (Actors) mentioned in dialogue and narrative\n",
    "- **Identify locations** (Locations) described or referenced in chunks\n",
    "- **Capture events** (Events) - actions, scenes, plot developments\n",
    "- **Note objects** (Objects) - items, artifacts mentioned in text\n",
    "- **Extract themes** (Intangibles) - concepts, emotions, ideas conveyed\n",
    "- **Maintain narrative flow** - ensure chunk order reflects story progression\n",
    "- **Add contextual properties** - enrich entities with relevant metadata\n",
    "- **Create meaningful relationships** - connect entities based on textual evidence\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Output a single structured JSON file** with metadata, nodes, and relationships\n",
    "2. **Include proper metadata section** with generation timestamp and counts\n",
    "3. **Structure nodes and relationships** in separate arrays within the JSON\n",
    "4. **Process literary content** - extract entities from book chapters and text chunks\n",
    "5. **Maintain hierarchical structure** - ensure Book→Chapter→Chunk relationships\n",
    "6. **Identify literary elements** - characters, settings, events, themes from text\n",
    "7. **Use sequential timestamps** to reflect narrative progression and chunk ordering\n",
    "8. **Reference node IDs correctly** - relationships must reference existing node IDs\n",
    "9. **Handle chunk ordering** - use chunk_order_number in properties for temporal sequencing\n",
    "10. **Include meaningful properties** - add relevant metadata to both nodes and relationships\n",

    "### Critical JSON Formatting Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use proper JSON syntax** - valid JSON with correct escaping\n",
    "- **Escape special characters** - quotes, backslashes, and control characters\n",
    "- **Use consistent data types** - integers for IDs, strings for text, floats for weights\n",
    "- **Include all required fields** - id, label, name, description for nodes; start_id, end_id, relationship_type, weight for relationships\n",
    "- **Maintain valid structure** - proper nesting and array formatting\n",
    "- **Use ISO timestamps** - consistent datetime format throughout\n",
    "\n",
    "### Literary Processing Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract characters** (Actors) mentioned in dialogue and narrative\n",
    "- **Identify locations** (Locations) described or referenced in chunks\n",
    "- **Capture events** (Events) - actions, scenes, plot developments\n",
    "- **Note objects** (Objects) - items, artifacts mentioned in text\n",
    "- **Extract themes** (Intangibles) - concepts, emotions, ideas conveyed\n",
    "- **Maintain narrative flow** - ensure chunk order reflects story progression\n",
    "- **Add contextual properties** - enrich entities with relevant metadata\n",
    "- **Create meaningful relationships** - connect entities based on textual evidence\n",
    "\n",
